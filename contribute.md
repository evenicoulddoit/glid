How can you help


 - Make others aware of this project.
The  project can be successful only if wide public is using it, so if nothing else, then mentioned it to your co-workers, friends, talk about it on the bus with strangers, 

 - Commit your own projects install instructions
You are developing a software, which you want to make sure everyone can install, then commit your project install instructions

 - Help us to ask the right questions
When working out a new standard, the data structure is a key, so if you think that you spot some key information missing from the data-structure, or something is in the wrong level, wrong place, open a ticket and/or send a PR

 - Help us write a parser
Once we have a bunch of data, we also need a tool to process that, if you know python check the source, 

anywho, feel free to open tickets, send PR's or just reach out
